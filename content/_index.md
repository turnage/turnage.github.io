### Or for Professional Reasons?

I'm a software engineer. I've worked on real-time systems, general backend
plumbing, low-level media services, and other stuff. Right now I'm committed to
[Mercury](https://mercury.com), where my coworkers are _sick_ and committed to
technical exellence.

Check out my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/turnage/)
and [github](https://github.com/turnage).

### Or to Buy Art?

On request I will ship signed archival-quality prints of my artwork. You can
also ask about NFTs, and see what existing mints haven't been collected yet in
my [showtime](https://tryshowtime.com/turnage).
